Question 1:
What is the primary focus of science?
A) Uncovering supernatural causes for natural phenomena
B) Uncovering natural causes for natural phenomena
C) Proposing untestable ideas about the world
D) Exploring subjective experiences
Answer: B) Uncovering natural causes for natural phenomena
Explanation: Science focuses on explaining the world through inquiry and observation, seeking natural causes for natural phenomena that can be observed and measured.

Question 2:
Which of the following best describes a scientific theory?
A) A guess or hunch with little evidence
B) A testable hypothesis for a specific observation
C) A well-supported explanation that has undergone extensive testing
D) A statement based on unverified assumptions
Answer: C) A well-supported explanation that has undergone extensive testing
Explanation: A theory in science is broader than a hypothesis and is supported by a substantial body of evidence after extensive and varied testing.

Question 3:
What does the term “locus” refer to in genetics?
A) The type of cell in which a gene is found
B) The specific location of a gene on a chromosome
C) The total number of genes in an organism
D) The part of the cell where DNA replication occurs
Answer: B) The specific location of a gene on a chromosome
Explanation: A locus is the fixed position on a chromosome where a particular gene is located.

Question 4:
Which statement correctly describes asexual reproduction?
A) It results in offspring with genetic material from two parents.
B) It leads to offspring that are genetically identical to the parent.
C) It creates more genetic variation than sexual reproduction.
D) It only occurs in multicellular organisms.
Answer: B) It leads to offspring that are genetically identical to the parent.
Explanation: Asexual reproduction involves a single parent, producing genetically identical offspring, also known as clones.

Question 5:
What is a homologous chromosome?
A) A chromosome that only carries one set of genes
B) A chromosome that is only found in reproductive cells
C) A pair of chromosomes, one from each parent, carrying genes for the same traits
D) A single chromosome that replicates independently
Answer: C) A pair of chromosomes, one from each parent, carrying genes for the same traits
Explanation: Homologous chromosomes are similar pairs that carry genes for the same traits but may have different alleles.
